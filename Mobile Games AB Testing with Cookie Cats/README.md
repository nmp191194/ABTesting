*Learning points*:
  - A/B Testing: compare 2 versions of the same population to understand / estimate the effects of a single event (treatment) on the population
    - The most basic form of randomized controlled experimentation -> must have a sufficient sample size to achieve statistical significance
  - Bootstrapping: iteratively resampling a dataset with replacement
    - Assuming the dataset's sample is representative enough of the population, this method can give us estimates of the population's descriptive statistics
